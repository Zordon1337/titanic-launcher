Titanic Launcher (osu.titanic.sh).

After multiple requests, i have decided to open source it, since i have "discontinued" the launcher year ago aka too lazy to make updates
and the api changed A LOT, which made current version unusable. Basically if you want it working, 
fork it, fix it, and do pr if you want.
